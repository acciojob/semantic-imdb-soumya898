					The film is set in 2015. Siddharth, a young doctor who completed his MBBS from Bhubaneswar, has been posted to Janbai PHC, a cut-off tribal area in the Malkangiri district of Odisha.

As per the guidelines of Government of Odisha, medical students studying in Government sponsored medical courses have to serve in tribal or rural areas of Odisha for 5 years otherwise they have to pay 5 crore bond price. So, Siddharth has to go there without his wishes. Janbai PHC having 151 villages under it and infamous for Naxals dominance with no basic facilities. Siddharth arrives there with much difficulties and meets Ravindra(Pharmacist). It was very difficult for him to cope with the new place. He tried to escape from the village by resigning. However a villager brought his daughter for treatment thinking it's a DUMA(ghost) but, as per diagnosis it was found out to be Malaria.

His associates informed him there is 151 villages in remote hilly terrains where people aren't interested to come to hospital as they treat their diseases by exorcism. Siddharth decides to spread awareness in the villages. By the help of some locals he first went to a village and approach them to take free Malaria tests. In the other village he was unable to save a girl from exorcism as she died. Determined to eradicate malaria he himself visits all the villages providing test kits and medication. During his visit to a certain village, the naxalites hijacked the village where Sidhharth and Ravindra carried a pregnant lady for 10 km where he was unsuccessful to take her to Malkangiri  <br>
hospital due to unavailability of boat to cross a river, then decided to take her to his PHC where delivery successfully happened. Soon he realises that these villagers need mosquito nets. He meets the CDMO to approach DM to provide funds. Somehow he is successful in his mission. <br> <br> <br>
After six months it was shown that villagers are not using the mosquito nets, and are using those in different activities. Hence Malaria returned again this time it took so many lives where Sidhharth feels helpless. Siddharth and Ravindra assumed villagers may not using nets as per guidelines. Hence he gave a presentation in the presence of CDMO and DM to conduct a large scale awareness campaign with the help from other Government bodies for the malaria awareness involving government officials where the mission was successful. 3 years later, as per ground reports malaria brought down from 40% to 4%. Siddharth bids adieu to the villagers as they emotionally says good bye to him. Siddharth leaves Janbai for his further studies.
